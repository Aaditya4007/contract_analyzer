# LLM-Powered Legal Contract Analysis Pipeline

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive, end-to-end pipeline for intelligent analysis of legal contracts using Large Language Models (LLMs). The system automates the traditionally manual and time-consuming process of contract review, offering capabilities for clause extraction, summarization, and advanced semantic analysis using Google's Gemini model as its core analytical engine.
